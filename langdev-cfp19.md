# LangDev'19: Call for Contributions

[LangDev](http://langdevcon.org/) is an informal two-day meeting dedicated to the state-of-the-art, state-of-the-practice -- and fun -- of language development using language workbenches. Language workbenches are integrated development environments for the construction, testing, composition, and evolution of software languages. A key feature of language workbenches is that they facilitate not only the construction of parsers, type checkers, compilers etc., but also associated editor services, such as syntax highlighting, formatting, outlining, error marking, hyperlinking, simulation, testing, debugging, etc.

On *March 21/22, 2019* the second edition of LangDev will be held, at [Amazon HQ in Amsterdam](https://goo.gl/maps/y8QomY8DGDQ2). In this call for contributions we sollicit talk proposals concerning the application, development, and innovation of language workbench technology. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Novel meta languages for language construction
- Experience reports on using language workbenches (i.e., case studies)
- Live programming support in language workbenches
- Modularity and composition approaches for language development
- Language evolution and versioning, model migration
- Deployment systems for languages developed using language workbenches
- New kinds of IDE features, both at the meta level, and object level
- Language workbench support for new language interaction models

[LangDev](http://langdevcon.org/) is an event targeted at both practitioners and researchers. We value interactive presentations with actual demonstrations over slide decks. Novelty with respect to the state-of-the-art is not a requirement, but talks should be interesting and/or thought-provoking for both academics and practitioners. 

Talk proposals should be submitted to [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQXexcqySTEE2Y1Zo4CyU6k7vUygvNpMfZ1TUEnfDvfj4v0g/viewform). A proposal should include
- Title
- A single-line surprising fact or statement that highlights the point of the talk
- A short abstract
- Presentation style (talk, demo, ...)

All proposals will undergo light reviewing by the program committee, consisting of:

- Markus Voelter
- Tijs van der Storm
- Sebastian Erdweg
- Tamas Szabo
