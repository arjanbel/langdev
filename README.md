## LangDev Meetup at RWTH Aachen 26-28 September 2022

The Language Developer’s Meetup (LangDev) is an informal meeting where language engineering enthusiasts from both industry and academia can come together to discuss the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of language engineering.  

<strong> LangDev'22 is generously sponsored by [mgm technology partners GmbH](https://a12.mgm-tp.com/) </strong>

### Call for Presentations

We solicit talk proposals concerning the application, development, and innovation of language engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Novel meta languages for language construction and composition
* Holistic approaches to language engineering that cross-cut multiple language aspects (e.g., abstract and concrete syntax, semantics, transformations) and/or integrate with program analysis, validation, testing, or other advanced techniques. 
* New language workbenches or novel extensions of existing language workbenches.
* Backend infrastructure of (web-based) language workbenches explaining solutions to collaboration, synchronization, or communication. 
* Industrial case studies: experience reports, large-scale evaluations, best practices, and human factors to adoption. 
* Low-Code / No-Code approaches using appropriate languages
  * Languages for describing and deriving digital twins
  * Languages for non-engineering issues, such as science, legal, social, or environmental sustainability issues
  * DSLs engineered on the basis of GPLs and GPMLs (general-purpose languages)

LangDev seeks presentations that demonstrate applied aspects of language engineering. Presentations explaining the theory behind language engineering are also welcome, but they need to showcase the practical applicability of the presented approaches. Presentations about preliminary or unfinished work are welcome.  

We encourage presenters to demonstrate their work with a **demo or live coding** over “just” showing slides. Additionally, we encourage speakers to accompany their presentations with a **reproduction package** that helps the participants to (easily) run the presented tools, experiment with them, or tweak benchmark experiments. This helps to create a lasting contribution. 

**Talk proposals should be submitted by August 15 via [easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=langdev22).** A proposal includes a title and a short (maximum 200 words) abstract. In case the talk is accompanied by a demo, we encourage presenters to also provide a brief demo outline as part of the proposal. Presenters will have 30 minutes for their talks (25 min talk + 5 min Q&A). Presenters may choose to follow a traditional presentation style where the Q&A is at the end of the talk, or they may follow a chess timer-based style. Notifications about acceptance will be sent out by September 01.
