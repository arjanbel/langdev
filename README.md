## Update on the Corona pandemic ## 

It is clear enough now that LangDev'20 cannot take place as planned. We have canceled the conference room and catering and closed the registration site. We will reimburse those who already registered. Given that LangDev is an informal meeting focused on socializing, we (the PC) don’t think an online-style conference is a useful replacement of the in-person workshop. Instead, we will postpone the workshop and reschedule it when the pandemic is resolved.

## LangDev Meetup at JGU Mainz 27-28 April 2020

The Language Developer’s Meetup (LangDev) is an informal two-day meeting where language engineering enthusiasts from both industry and academia can come together to discuss the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of language engineering. 

### Location

JGU Mainz Helmholtz-Institut building - Staudingerweg 18 - 55128 Mainz, Germany

### Call for Presentations

We solicit talk proposals concerning the application, development, and innovation of language engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Novel meta languages for language construction and composition
* Holistic approaches to language engineering that cross cut multiple language aspects (e.g. abstract and concrete syntax, semantics, transformations) and/or integrate with program analysis, validation, testing, or other advanced techniques. 
* New language workbenches or novel extensions of existing language workbenches.
* Backend infrastructure of (web-based) language workbenches explaining solutions to collaboration, synchronization, or communication. 
* Industrial case studies: experience reports, large-scale evaluations, best practices, and human factors to adoption. 

LangDev seeks presentations that demonstrate applied aspects of language engineering. Presentations explaining the theory behind language engineering are also welcome, but they need to showcase the practical applicability of the presented approaches. Presentations about preliminary or unfinished work are welcome.  

We encourage presenters to demonstrate their work with a **demo or live coding** over “just” showing slides. Additionally, we encourage speakers to accompany their presentations with a **reproduction package** that helps the participants to (easily) run the presented tools, experiment with them, or to tweak benchmark experiments. This helps to create a lasting contribution. 

**Talk proposals should be submitted by February 29 through [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/snX7orjhXm1cKWcd7).** A proposal includes a title and a short (maximum 200 words) abstract. In case the talk is accompanied by a demo, we encourage presenters to also provide a brief demo outline as part of the proposal. Presenters will have 30 minutes for their talks (25 min talk + 5 min Q&A). Presenters may choose to follow a traditional presentation style where the Q&A is at the end of the talk, or they may follow a chess timer-based style. Notifications about acceptance will by sent out by March 14. 

### Registration

Please use [this website]() (**CLOSED**) for registration. 
Registration fee is 110 EUR, and it includes coffee breaks and lunch on both days.
**The deadline for registration is March 26.**
